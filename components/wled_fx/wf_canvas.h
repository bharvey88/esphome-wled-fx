/* The canvas replaces WLED's per-segment pixel buffer (wled00/FX.h Segment::pixels).
 * It is allocated once at setup and never resized while an effect is running, which
 * is what lets the effect bodies keep WLED's lossless read-back behaviour on every
 * output type.
 *
 * This file is original work for this repository. It holds no WLED code; only the
 * role it plays comes from WLED.
